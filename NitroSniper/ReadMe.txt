		[Nitro Sniper]
	     Written By: Backslash

[+] Intro
	First off, I hope you enjoy the simple sniper I wrote, I wrote this somewhere around 2 months ago and didn't really have a purpose for it so I decided to release it to everyone for free. If you bought this from someone then you got scammed.

[+] Setup
	1. So in order to use this file you need to install python 3.7 (this is my reccomendation) From Here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.4/python-3.7.4-amd64.exe
	2. Make sure when you run the executable that you choose the option add to path down by the bottem otherwise you will run into a lot of issues. This is because the enviroment variables will NOT work.
	3. So I made a file called setup.py you can just double click that and let it run, if it doesn't work then you will need to open up console and type in the following commands: 
		pip install discord
		pip install requests
		pip install logging
		pip install coloredlogs
	4. Make sure to get your user token and stick it in the file called "settings.ini" replace the text which says token with your discord token, you can find your token by using this method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvCtWDQtz6A. (NEVER SHARE YOUR TOKEN WITH ANYONE ITS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR ACCOUNT)
[IMPORTANT] If you run into an error, most of the time my dms are open however please do search on https://www.google.com, I don't really enjoy answering the same questions over and over.

[+] Running
	[Option 1]
		- Option one is just double click the file itself and let it run, it should open up a terminal screen and show up blank at first, give it a few minutes to log in. Once its succesfully logged in it will return your username saying youve logged in. Then just let it sit there and claim those nitro codes.
	[Option 2] 
		- Open up terminal use the commands listed below:
			cd folder path in which the file is located
			pyton NitroSniper.py
[+] Advice

	- Stick your bot in the top 100 discord servers (https://discordservers.me/servers/top-100)
	- Place it in those toxic e dating servers, omfg those drop nitros a shitton. Legit thats been my method.
	- Find nitro oriented servers.

[+] Final Note
	Technically this violates discords rule on selfbots, will they care not really, ive been using selfbots for years mainly because it makes my life a hell lot easier. If this does however violate your morals I fully understand and your free to not use this.
