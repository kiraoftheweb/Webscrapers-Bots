# WebScrapers
  Here are a collection of webscrapers and bots I've written, feel free to take a look, if anything peaks your curosity consider starring them. I won't be updating most of these likely because I've moved onto more interesting stuff.
  
#### LinkScraper
  I needed proxies in the moment for some of my other bot scripts so this came in handy.
  
#### ProxyList
  I needed proxies in the moment for some of my other bot scripts so this came in handy.
  
#### UsProxyScraper
  I needed proxies in the moment for some of my other bot scripts so this came in handy.

#### GithubStarClone
  This was made merely because I needed to backup a ton of starred repos that I found to be important. If you need to backup a ton of repos consider using this since I was unable to found subsitutes for quickly cloning repos.

#### NitroSniper
  Made this as a proof of concept nearly 5-6 months ago, still works, its a simple demonstration on how requests can be used to instantly claim working nitro codes. I made this at first when NitroSnipers werent abundent everywhere, now that everyone uses them its not worth it to keep it running. That being said I got some use out of it.

#### PornhubBot
  Ok before you make fun of me for this bot, I was incredibly bored and wanted to mess around with a different site and figured I could get a good laugh for this. This bot was all done for the memes. It's not great code and its as of now 3 months old.

#### Points2Prizes
  This was made a simple demonstration of requests being used to bot points for the site Points2Prizes. It takes a given invite code and abuses the signup processes to get tons of points.
